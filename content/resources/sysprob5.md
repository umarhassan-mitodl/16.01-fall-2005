description: This file contains the exercise which contains Test a three-dimensional
  truss under transverse loading; (b) Measure its load-deflection characteristics
  and the strain in its internal bars/members; (c) Use the strain to determine the
  loads in the internal bars/members; (d) Compare the loads to values from analysis
  of a two-dimensional model of the truss; (e) Write a short laboratory report documenting
  your findings.

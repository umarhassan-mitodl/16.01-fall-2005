description: This resource contains information on rules for the end of semester competition.
  During the spring semester, most systems problems relate to the semester's aerial
  design competition.  Teams of four or five students work together to design an aircraft
  to achieve the highest score. To optimize their system, each team must evaluate
  trades between payload, endurance, maneuverability and durability, subject to the
  constraints and objectives of the aerial competition.
